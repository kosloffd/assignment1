#My Bio

My current interest, whether I like it or not is my daughter.  She is 9 months old and consumes all my time when my wife doesn't take over.  The hobbies that I used to have before my daughter include:
*reading
*golf
*running
*hiking
*guitar

After graduating business college, I enrolled in the inaugural post-baccalaureate Computer Science program at OSU, then was required to promptly withdraw when my new job wanted me to start working seven days per week.
