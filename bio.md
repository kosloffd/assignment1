#My Bio

My current interest, whether I like it or not is my daughter.  She is 9 months old and consumes all my time when my wife doesn't take over.  The hobbies that I used to have before my daughter include:
*reading
*golf
*running
*hiking
*guitar

##Programming Background
My programming background is somewhat limited.  I have read and worked through several books on HTML, Java, C++, MySQL, but the real test for me is using these skills outside of studying, and I haven't done much of that.
