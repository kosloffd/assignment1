#My Bio

My current interest, whether I like it or not is my daughter.  She is 9 months old and consumes all my time when my wife doesn't take over.  The hobbies that I used to have before my daughter include:
*reading
*golf
*running
*hiking
*guitar

After graduating business college, I enrolled in the inaugural post-baccalaureate Computer Science program at OSU, then was required to promptly withdraw when my new job wanted me to start working seven days per week.

##Programming Background
My programming background is somewhat limited.  I have read and worked through several books on HTML, Java, C++, MySQL, but the real test for me is using these skills outside of studying, and I haven't done much of that. My favorite programming projects were the graphical applications.  When I took CS 161 and 162 they taught Java and had us create a Battleship game, which was probably my favorite assignment. 
The only time I tried to take those skills and put them to use in the "real world" was when I began creating forms to replace the paper forms we use for my work, but that project was never finished.  I'm excited to find employment following this degree, as it will ensure that I use these skills consistently and will eventually be able to master a few of them.
